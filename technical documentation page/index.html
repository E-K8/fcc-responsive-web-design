          Object-Oriented Programming Concepts teaches you the core concepts
          behind object-oriented programming: objects, messages, classes, and
          inheritance. This lesson ends by showing you how these concepts
          translate into code. Feel free to skip this lesson if you are already
          familiar with object-oriented programming.

        <header>Classes and Objects</header>
        <p>
          Classes and Objects describes how to write the classes from which
          objects are created, and how to create and use the objects.

        <p>
          Annotations are a form of metadata and provide information for the
          compiler. This lesson describes where and how to use annotations in a
          program effectively.

        <header>Interfaces and Inheritance</header>
        <p>
          Interfaces and Inheritance describes interfacesâ€”what they are, why you
          would want to write one, and how to write one. This section also
          describes the way in which you can derive one class from another. That
          is, how a subclass can inherit fields and methods from a superclass.
          You will learn that all classes are derived from the Object class, and
          how to modify the methods that a subclass inherits from superclasses.

          Numbers and Strings This lesson describes how to use Number and String
          objects The lesson also shows you how to format data for output.

        <header>Generics</header>
        <p>
          Generics are a powerful feature of the Java programming language. They
          improve the type safety of your code, making more of your bugs
          detectable at compile time.

        <header>Packages</header>
        <p>
          Packages are a feature of the Java programming language that help you
          to organize and structure your classes and their relationships to one
          another.
